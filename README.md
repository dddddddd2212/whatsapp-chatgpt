# WhatsApp Chatbot with OpenAI's GPT-3

This is a Python Flask app that can be used as a WhatsApp chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3. When you send a message to your Twilio WhatsApp number, it will trigger the Flask app to generate a response using GPT-3, and then send the response back to your phone number via Twilio.

## Prerequisites

- A [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)
- A GPT-3 API key from OpenAI
- [Python >=3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) installed (for testing purposes)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/mo12896/whatsapp-chatgpt.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd whatsapp-chatbot-gpt3`
3. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set the following environment variables in your shell or system environment:
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` - Your Twilio Account SID
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` - Your Twilio Auth Token
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API Key
   - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` - Your Twilio WhatsApp phone number
   - `YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER` - Your personal phone number
5. Start the Flask app: `python app.py`
6. Start ngrok by running `ngrok http 5000` in another terminal window.
7. In your [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console), go to the [WhatsApp Senders](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/whatsapp/senders) page and configure your "When a message comes in" webhook with the ngrok URL, e.g. `https://abcd1234.ngrok.io/whatsapp`.
8. Send a WhatsApp message to your Twilio number and enjoy!

## Notes

- The Flask app is set to listen on port 5000 by default. If you want to use a different port, set the `PORT` environment variable to your desired port.
- When using ngrok, make sure to update the ngrok URL in your Twilio console every time you restart ngrok.
- This app is just a starting point and can be extended to fit your needs. You can modify the `generate_response` function to customize the response generated by GPT-3, or add more functionality to the Flask app as needed.
